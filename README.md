Establish the digital/PWM pins as specified in the code (or configurate them as desired)

### 1.3 SOFTWARE configuration

- Clone the repository.
  
- Connect your device to the raspberryPI.

- Run the file vehicle.py in the raspberryPI. To do this you have 2 options:
  
  - Upload the code to the raspberry and execute it
    
  - Create a remote interpreter in Pycharm and execute the code through this interpreter

> [!TIP]
> Connect the raspberry to the device via ssh.
